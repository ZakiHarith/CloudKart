# Complete AWS Deployment Guide for CloudKart

This guide will walk you through deploying your CloudKart web application to AWS using a **complete, production-ready infrastructure** without using AWS CLI.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

We'll deploy CloudKart using a comprehensive AWS infrastructure that includes:
- **VPC** - Secure network environment
- **EC2** - Web server hosting your application
- **DynamoDB** - NoSQL database for data storage
- **CloudFront** - Global CDN for performance
- **S3** - Static file storage and backups

This setup is:
- âœ… **FREE** tier eligible for students
- âœ… **Scalable** as your application grows
- âœ… **Secure** with proper network isolation
- âœ… **Professional** production-ready architecture

3. Install web server and runtime
4. Configure security groups

### Phase 2: Database Setup

#### Step 4: Configure DynamoDB
1. Follow the detailed guide in `dynamodb-setup.md`
2. Create tables for products, users, and orders
3. Set up global secondary indexes
4. Add sample data

### Phase 3: Application Deployment

#### Step 5: Deploy Your Application
1. Upload your CloudKart files to EC2
2. Install dependencies and configure database connections
3. Start your web application
4. Test all functionality

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization

#### Step 6: Set Up CloudFront CDN
1. Follow the detailed guide in `cloudfront-setup.md`
2. Create distribution pointing to your EC2 instance
3. Configure caching policies
4. Enable HTTPS

#### Step 7: Configure S3 for Static Files
1. Follow the detailed guide in `s3-setup.md`
2. Upload product images and static assets
3. Configure CloudFront to serve from S3
4. Optimize file storage

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!

Your CloudKart web application is now live on AWS with a complete, production-ready infrastructure! You now have:

- âœ… **Secure Network**: VPC with proper security groups
- âœ… **Web Server**: EC2 instance running your application
- âœ… **Database**: DynamoDB storing your data
- âœ… **Global CDN**: CloudFront for fast worldwide access
- âœ… **Static Storage**: S3 for images and assets
- âœ… **HTTPS**: Secure connections via CloudFront

## ðŸ”§ Optional: Add CloudFront CDN

For better performance and a custom domain, see `cloudfront-setup.md`.

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Application Not Loading
- Check EC2 instance is running
- Verify security group rules allow HTTP/HTTPS
- Check application logs on EC2
- Ensure database connection is working

### Database Connection Errors
- Verify DynamoDB tables exist
- Check AWS credentials on EC2
- Ensure IAM role has DynamoDB permissions
- Test database queries manually

### Performance Issues
- Check CloudFront cache hit ratio
- Monitor EC2 CPU and memory usage
- Optimize database queries
- Enable CloudFront compression

## ðŸ’° Cost Monitoring

- **EC2**: Monitor instance hours and data transfer
- **DynamoDB**: Track read/write capacity usage
- **CloudFront**: Monitor data transfer and requests
- **S3**: Track storage and request usage

Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges.

## ðŸ“š Next Steps

1. **Custom Domain**: Add your own domain name
2. **SSL Certificate**: Enable HTTPS (included with CloudFront)
3. **Monitoring**: Set up CloudWatch dashboards
4. **Backup**: Configure automated backups
5. **Scaling**: Add auto-scaling for high traffic

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Outcomes

After completing this deployment, you'll understand:
- **AWS Core Services**: VPC, EC2, DynamoDB, CloudFront, S3
- **Cloud Architecture**: Multi-tier application design
- **Security**: Network isolation and access control
- **Performance**: CDN and caching strategies
- **Cost Management**: Resource optimization and monitoring
- **DevOps**: Infrastructure management and deployment
